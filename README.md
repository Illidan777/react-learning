# React Learning Projects

This repository contains several projects aimed at learning and exploring React concepts and best practices.

## Project Structure

### `base-react-proj`
A simple project introducing the fundamental concepts of React, including:
- Components
- State and props
- Lifting state up

This serves as an introduction to React's core principles.

### `pre-main-react-proj-marvel`
A more realistic project built using class components. This project demonstrates:
- State management within class components
- Lifecycle methods
- Error boundaries for handling unexpected component errors

### `main-react-proj-on-hooks`
The same project as `pre-main-react-proj-marvel`, but rewritten using modern React techniques such as:
- Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.)
- React Router for navigation
- Performance optimizations with `useMemo` and `React.lazy`

### `separate-topics`
This folder contains various standalone examples focusing on specific React features, such as:
- Portals
- Refs
- Higher-order components (HOCs)
- In-depth exploration of individual hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`

## Getting Started
Each project has its own setup and dependencies. To run a project:

1. Navigate to the desired project folder:
   ```sh
   cd base-react-proj
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Requirements
